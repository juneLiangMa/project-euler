# project-euler
a repo for my attempts at solving project euler problems

Project done in Java, because I use C# at work and want to just use something different for home projects.

Branch/Development summary/timeline

# problem1

Problem 1 is the first problem in Project Euler. Given some upper limit n, and two integer values u and v, find the sum of all the multiples of the two integers u and v that are less than n.

# consoleapp-dev

This is a branch I made to make a console application that can run the solutions I've uploaded and display some helpful information about them. Basically, as I make more solutions, I don't want to have to keep updating the code in my main method class to run my solution.

Obviously if I had just done all the euler problems in a language like Python, I could probably resolve all of this much faster, but I like writing console applications and adding that part to the program.
